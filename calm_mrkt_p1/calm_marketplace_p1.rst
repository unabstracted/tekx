Calm Glossary
*************

- **Service:** One tier of a multiple tier application. This can be made up of 1 more VMs (or existing machines) that all have the same config and do the same thing
- **Application (App):** A whole application with multiple parts that are all working towards the same thing (for example, a Web Application might be made up of an Apache Server, a MySQL database and a HAProxy Load balancer. Alone each service doesn’t do much, but as a whole they do what they’re supposed to)
- **Macro:** A Calm construct that is evaluated before being ran on the target machine. Macros and Variables are denoted in the *@@{[name]}@@* format in the scripts.

Navigate the to Marketplace control by clicking (|image1|) icon located on the left tool ribbon.  This will open the Marketplace Control Center where pre-configured and self-authored blueprints are staged for publishing to the local Marketplace used for teaming and collaboration.

In this exercise we'll walk through the steps to:

1. Publish the pre-configured MongoDB Blueprint to the local Marketplace
2. Clone the Blueprint from the Marketplace for editing.
3. Edit the blueprint and launch as an application.

Make sure *Marketplace Blueprints* is selected along the top of the Blueprint grid. Locate the **Mongo** blueprint within the grid and click the checkbox.

Once the **Mongo** Blueprint has been selected, a catalog is displayed to the right of the grid containing a blueprint description, category, and project assignment. Insure both **Database** and **Calm** are selected for the categroy and project repsectively, and click *apply*.
