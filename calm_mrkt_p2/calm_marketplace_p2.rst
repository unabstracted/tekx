**************************


Overview
************
.. note:: Estimated time to completion: **40 MINUTES**

In this lab participants will learn how to manage Blueprints within the NuCalm Marketplace.  After this lab
participants should know how to navigate Marketplace Management and configure the Project Environment to deploy Blueprints
from the Marketplace.

In this exercise we'll walk through the steps to:

1. Publish a Blueprint from the Blueprint Workspace to the local Marketplace.
2. Use the Marketplace Manager to approve, assign roles and projects, and publish to the Marketplace.
3. Edit the Project Environment so the blueprint can be launched from the Marketplace as an application.

Calm Glossary
*************
- **Service:** One tier of a multiple tier application. This can be made up of 1 more VMs (or existing machines) that all have the same config and do the same thing.
- **Application (App):** A whole application with multiple parts that are all working towards the same thing (for example, a Web Application might be made up of an Apache Server, a MySQL database and a HAProxy Load balancer. Alone each service doesn’t do much, but as a whole they do what they’re supposed to).
- **Macro:** A Calm construct that is evaluated before being ran on the target machine. Macros and Variables are denoted in the *@@{[name]}@@* format in the scripts.
