Overview
************

.. note:: Estimated time to complete: **2.5 HOURS**

The Automation Lab starts with an introduction to Calm REST API, and associated JSON. The lab is a set of exercises designed to walk participants through navigating the REST API Explorer, locating Blueprint and Appication REST requests, executing the requests, and observing the results using both the Swagger generated API Explorer (Prism Central) and Postman (optional). Participants will also deploy several commands using python.

NTNX REST API Explorer Requests:

- App
- Blueprint
- Role
- Project

Reference:
============

- REST/HTTP Overview: REST-HTTP-Overview_
- NTNX REST API Explorer Overview:  NTNX-REST-API-Explorer-Overview_

Execution & Development:
========================

- Chrome Web Browser + Developer Tools
- Chrome JSON Editor: Chrome-JSON-Editor-Extension_
- CentOS Server v7 VM.
   - *Python 2.7.x*, *requests*, and *git* installed
- Git Hub Account: https://github.com


Create a CentOS Server v7 VM
****************************
Create a CentOS Server v7 VM on the assigned cluster using Prism Central with the folloiwng specifications:

- vCPU: 2x, 1x core/vCPU
- mem:  4 GiB
- network: bootcamp
- name: calm_lab_dev
- image: CentOS Server v7  (Disk)

Create a Development Runtime
****************************

**Install pip, and requests:**

Power-on the VM and login to the assigned *ip-address* as **user:** *root*, **password:** *nutanix/4u* using *ssh* or *putty*.

We'll need to make sure the python 2.7 runtime has all the appropriate packages, sepcifically *pip* and *requests*. We'll provision a CentOS Server VM to insure participants are working fromm a common-base.

- Pip is a tool for installing and managing Python packages.
- Requests is a Python package used to conmunicate over http.

*pip* is part of Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL), which is a community repository of non-standard packages for the RHEL distribution. You'll be required to install the EPEL repository.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ yum install epel-release

As a matter of best practice we’ll update our package(s)

.. code-block:: bash

  $ yum -y update

Then let’s install python-pip and any required packages:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ yum -y install python-pip

View a list of helpful commands, and check the version of *pip* that is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip --help
  $ pip --version

Once *pip has been installed and verified, we can now install *requests* as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install requests

Configure Postman (Optional)
****************************
This lab will use Postman allowing you to preserve the v3 REST API Requests so they can be used later when demonstrating NuCalm REST API's and HOW-TO guidance with a partner or customer.  If you use another REST API tool, feel to use it in place of Postman.

Lab setup for Postman:  configure-postman_

Accessing the REST API's
************************
A link for launching the REST API Explorer may not be accessible via Prism Central - specifically in the case of AOS v5.5.  The explorer can be launched by explicitly typing the *url* in the address bar of your browser as follows:

.. note:: The NTNX v3 REST API Explorer in AOS v5.5.0.x can only be accessed using the Prism Central(PC) *url* typed into the active browsers address bar.

.. code-block:: bash

  https://[PC-IPADDRESS]:9440/api/nutanix/v3/api_explorer/index.html


.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image1.png

Once the API Explorer appears, be sure to authenticate or sign-in (as shown above) using the PC credentials.  Click **Explorer** to authenicate.  The explorer should refresh and display the REST API Targets + requests.

Issuing List Requests
*********************

In this section we'll learn how to navigate the REST API Explorer in order to read and gather information for:

- App(s)
- Blueprint(s)
- Project(s)
- Role(s)

Reading from v3 REST targets are consistent and are typically shown as *list* and executed as a POST command.  The *response* from a *list request* returns a subset of element information.  To retrieve all-inclusive element information, you'll use the element's *uuid* and issue a GET request.

All *list* requests require a small payload.  The following is the minimal payload required:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": "",
    "offset": 0,
    "length": 20
  }


- *filter:* explicit filter i.e. *name* or *state[DELETED|ACTIVE]*
- *offset:* starting element
- *length:* the #of elements to return from the *offset*

**App:**

1. Navigate the REST API Explorer, find *app* and expand by clicking *List Operations*.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image7.png

2. Find **POST** */apps/list* and click to expand.  Copy the JSON code block shown above and paste it in the *get_entities_request*.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image8.png

3. Click *Try it out!* to execute the **POST** */apps/list Request*...  A *Response Code* of 200 indicates the request was successfully executed:

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image11.png

4. Valid content should be accessible in the **Response Body**. Each *app* element and associated information is enclosed within several objects (i.e. *status* , *metadata*, and *spec*).  Scroll through the contents and take a mental inventory to better understand what information is made available for an *app* in the */apps/list* request.

.. code-block:: bash

  {
      "status": {
        "last_update_time": 1513976128766499,
        "description": "Accessibility:\n* http://[IP_ADDRESS]:8080",
        "deletion_time": 1,
        "deleted": false,
        "creation_time": 1513975513568314,
        "spec_version": 3,
        "uuid": "26352103-60d5-45c3-81d1-9504c81f456b",

        .
        .
        .

      }
   }


5. Run and persist in Postman (optional): postman-execution_

**Blueprint:**

Repeat steps 1-5 above, substituting *app* with *blueprint* and */blueprints/list*.

**Project:**

Repeat steps 1-5 above, substituting *app* with *project* and */projects/list*.

**Role:**

Repeat steps 1-5 above, substituting *app* with *role* and */roles/list*.

Summary
==========

The key takeway of this exercise is that it provides an inventory of elements with a small subset of metadata that can be used to retrieve more comprehensive data using other NTNX NuCalm REST API requests...

Issuing GET/UUID Requests
*************************

In this section we'll learn how to Navigate the REST API Explorer to read and gather information for a single element using **GET**. The elements are as follows:

- App(s)
- Blueprint(s)
- Project(s)
- Role(s)

**App:**

1. In the previous section **Issuing List Requests**, examine the **Response Body** for */apps/list* and copy an elements *uuid* located under *status*.

2. Navigate the REST API Explorer, find *app* and expand by clicking *List Operations*.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image7.png

3. Find **GET** */apps/{uuid}* and click to expand.  Paste the *uuid* copied from step 1 into the value txt-field of the *uuid* paramater field for the **GET** /apps/{uuid}.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image18.png

4. Click *Try it out!* to execute the **GET** */apps/{uuid} Request*...  A *Response Code* of 200 indicates the request was successfully executed.

5. Valid content should be accessible in the **Response Body**. The *app* element and associated information is enclosed within the *status*, *spec*, and *metadata* objects.  Scroll through the contents and take a mental inventory.  Compare it to the results of an */apps/list* request.  Take note that the information returned by the **GET** */apps/uuid* is far more comprehensive than the **POST**  */apps/list* request.

.. code-block:: bash

  {

    "status": {
      "description": "Accessibility:\n* http://[IP_ADDRESS]:8080",
      "resources": {
        "app_state": "running",
        "action_list": [
          {
            "description": "This actions upgrades jenkins to latest version.",
            "type": "user",
            "uuid": "35267b32-21b2-468e-b9c5-b14493b7fc0b",
            "state": "NOT_VALIDATED",
            "critical": false,
            "attrs": {},
            "runbook": {

        .
        .
        .

   }


6. Run and persist in Postman (optional): postman-execution_


**Blueprint:**

Repeat steps 1-6 above, substituting *app* with *blueprint*, */blueprints/list* and */blueprints/uuid* respectively.

**Project:**

Repeat steps 1-6 above, substituting *app* with *project*, */projects/list* and */projects/uuid* respectively.

**Role:**

Repeat steps 1-6 above, substituting *app* with *role*, */roles/list* and */role/uuid* respectively.

Summary
==========

The key takeway of this exercise is that the **GET** */element/uuid* request provides detailed/comprehensive spec & metadata for a specified element that can be used as a payload for other NTNX NuCalm REST API requests...

Issuing a Import Blueprint Request
**********************************
In this section we'll Navigate the REST API Explorer to execute importing a blueprint from a file.  Typically, when Blueprints are exported, they're in JSON format.  This exercise will manually import a Blueprint.json file using the REST API.

.. note:: The NTNX v3 REST API is intentful, making the JSON very complex and difficult to manage for requests such as Import, Launch, Create, etc..., without using JSON edititng tools.  In the following exercise we'll use the JSON editor integrated as part of the Chrome client web-browser (see requirements Chrome-JSON-Editor-Extension_).

1. Start by opening the file contents from: Import-Blueprint.JSON_, and paste it to the Chrome JSON Editor (Chrome-JSON-Editor-Extension_). Once it's pasted, click (|image9|) to migrate the json to a node-structure.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image20.png

2. Remove the **status** content by right-clicking on the Node *Status*.  Select **Remove** from the menu.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image21.png

3. Insert an *object* to **metadata** by right-clicking on the Node *metadata*.  Select *insert* and then *object*.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image22.png

4. Name the object *project_reference*. Add 2 *string* members to the *project_reference* object by right-clicking on the node and select *append*.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image23.png

5. Name the **key/value** pairs as *kind:project*, and *uuid:[UUID for Calm Project]*.  Retrieving the the Calm project uuid as follows:

- Navigate the NTNX REST API Explorer and open **POST** *projects/list* REST API request. Copy the following JSON body and paste it in the *get_entities_request* field.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": "name==Calm",
    "offset": 0,
    "length": 10
  }

- Click *Try it out!* to invoke the **POST** */projects/list* request.
- Check for a status-code of 200.  The Project's *uuid* should be listed in the *Response Body*.  Copy and paste to the *project_reference* object.

- The object *project_reference* object should look similar to the following:

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image24.png

6. The *project_reference* object should be positioned under *metadata* node.  Expand the *metadata* node check to make sure this is the case.  If it doesn't, perform a **click-hold** on (|image15|) icon to the left of *project_reference* object and drag it under *metdata* node.  It should look as follows:

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image26.png

7. Modify the name of the blueprint under the *spec* object.  Expand the *spec* object, and edit *name* with *Import_API_Lab*

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image27.png

8. If all looks good, click the (|image18|) button to migrate the changes/updates made in the right **node** view panel to the left JSON view panel.

9. Select the entire JSON contents shown in the left JSON view panel and copy it to the Blueprint **POST** */blueprints/import_json* *body* within the v3 REST API Explorer.

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image29.png

10. Click *Try it out!* to invoke the **POST** */blueprints/import_json* request.

11. Check for a status-code of 200.

12. Using the REST API Explorer, navigate to **POST** *blueprints/list* REST API request and paste the following JSON to the *get_entities_request* field:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": "name==Import_API_Lab",
    "offset": 0,
    "length": 10
  }

13. Click *Try it out!* to invoke the **POST** */blueprints/list* request.

14. Check for a status-code of 200.  The Blueprint contents should be listed in the *Response Body*.

15. Refresh Prism Central and check Apps/Blueprints to insure the blueprint succesfully imported...

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image30.png

Summary
==========

You've successfully imported a blueprint from a file to NuCalm services within Prism Central using the NTNX REST API Explorer

Issuing an Update Blueprint Request
***********************************

Notice that the blueprint imported in the previous section is in **Draft** state.  This is due to an empty credentials *password*.  The Blueprint state must be *Active* to successfully launch the blueprint.  In this section, we'll update the imported blueprint's credential *password* in preperation for launching the application...

Workflow
===========

**GET** /blueprint_id ---> **PUT** /blueprint_id


1. Using the REST API Explorer, navigate to **POST** *blueprints/list* REST API request and paste the following JSON to the *get_entities_request* field:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": "name==Import_API_Lab",
    "offset": 0,
    "length": 10
  }

2. Click *Try it out!* to invoke the **POST** */blueprints/list* request.

3. Check for a status-code of 200.  The Blueprint contents should be listed in the *Response Body*.

4. Copy the UUID value from the *Response Body* , and paste it to the *uuid* value field of the Blueprint **GET** /blueprints/{uuid} API request call, and click *Try it out!* to invoke the request.

5. Verify the request returns a *Response code* of 200.

6. Copy the entire *Response Body* from the Blueprint **GET** */blueprints/{uuid}* API request and paste it to the Chrome JSON Editor (Chrome-JSON-Editor-Extension_). Once it's pasted, click (|image9|) to migrate the json to a node-structure.

7. Remove the **status** content by right-clicking on the Node *Status*.  Select **Remove** from the menu.

8. Expand the JSON node structure  and make the edits as shown below:

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image39.png

9. If all looks good, click the (|image18|) button to migrate the changes/updates made in the right **node** view panel to the left JSON view panel.

10. Select the entire JSON contents shown in the left JSON view panel and copy it to the Blueprint **PUT** */blueprints/{uuid}*  *Body* within the v3 REST API Explorer.  You'll also be required to copy the blueprint *uuid* to the *uuid* field as shown below:

11. Click *Try it out!* to invoke the **PUT** */blueprints/{uuid}/* request.

12. Check for a status-code of 200.

13. Verify the state of the Blueprint has changeed from **Draft** to **Active**.


Issuing a Launch Blueprint Request
**********************************

In this section we'll Navigate the REST API Explorer to execute launching a blueprint recently imported from the previous section.

.. note:: The NTNX v3 REST API is intentful, making the JSON very complex and difficult to manage for requests such as Import, Launch, Create, etc..., without using JSON edititng tools.  In the following exercise we'll use the JSON editor integrated as part of the Chrome client web-browser (see requirements Chrome-JSON-Editor-Extension_).

Workflow
==========

**POST** */blueprints/list* ----> **GET** */blueprints/{uuid}* ----> **POST** */blueprints/launch* ----> **POST** */apps/list*

1. Using the REST API Explorer, navigate to the Blueprint, **POST** */blueprints/list* and paste the following JSON into the *get_entities_request* field and click *Try it out!* to invoke the request.

.. code-block:: json

  }

17. Click *Try it out!* to invoke the **POST** */apps/list* request.

18. Check for a status-code of 200.  The application contents should be listed in the *Response Body*.

19. Refresh Prism Central and check Apps/apps to insure the blueprint succesfully launched...

.. figure:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/lab5/image38.png

.. note:: The response of 200 is expected indicating the launch was successful. The application provisioning will most likely fail and is expected.  The reason for the provisioning failure is due to the images being referenced on the cluster are different from where the blueprint was originally sourced.  The key takeway here is that it launched...

Summary
=======

You've successfully launched a blueprint that was previously imported from a file to NuCalm services within Prism Central using the NTNX REST API Explorer.


Issuing a Delete Application Request
************************************

In this section we'll Navigate the REST API Explorer to execute the deletion of an Active Application that was lancuhed as a Blueprint in the previous section.

Workflow
==========

**POST** */apps/list* ----> **POST** */apps/delete*

1. Using the REST API Explorer, navigate to the Blueprint, **POST** */apps/list* and paste the following JSON into the **get_entities_request** field and click *Try it out!* to invoke the request.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": "name==Launch_API_Lab",
    "offset": 0,
    "length": 20
  }

2. Verify the request returns a *Response Code* of 200.

3. Copy the UUID value from the *Response Body* , and paste it to the *uuid* value field of the Blueprint **DELETE** */apps/{uuid}* API request call, and click *Try it out!* to invoke the request.

4. Verify the request returns a *Response Code* of 200.

Summary
==========

You've successfully deleted an application that was previously imported and launched from a blueprint using the NTNX REST API Explorer.

Automation of REST Endpoints
****************************

In this section we'll run python code instrumented to programmatically perform the commands you ran manually from previous steps using the NTNX REST API Explorer.  You'll begin by installing *git*, configuring a dev environment, cloning an exiting *git* repository to the dev environment, and execute the code downloaded from the repository.


Install Git
=============

Starting from an active terminal session logged in as *root* to the CentOS v7 Server VM created earlier...

Install git:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ yum install git -y

Create dev environment
========================

Create a directory for development:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir /root/development
  $ cd /root/development

Download the autuomation-code (python) used to automate REST from *github* as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/mjastad/automation.git

If all was successfull you should find a directory */root/development/automation/solution/*

Edit */root/development/automation/solution/config.py* and set the connection variables (i.e. *user, passwd, ipaddress*) using the associated information for your assigned cluster.  Make sure the values are within quotes(**"some_value"**) as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  USER         = "admin"           < edit
  PASSWD       = "nx2Tech476!"     < edit
  IPADDRESS    = "10.21.81.39"     < edit
  PORT         = "9440"

Check If the **v2** imports and function calls are commented with *#* in file */root/development/automation/solution/main.py*.  If they aren't, be sure to comment **v2** imports and function calls using *#*, and uncomment **v3** imports by removing *#* as shown:

.. code-block:: python

  #!/usr/bin/env python

  """
  File: main.py: NTNX REST API Driver.
  """
